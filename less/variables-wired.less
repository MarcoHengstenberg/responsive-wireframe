	Basic font color â€“ we don't want black or #333
	Not only is it boring but it is also a wee bit stupid to
	think that anywhere in nature such a plain color would appear.

	Ask "designers" or "photographers" with a lot of experience and they
	will tell you that there is no true BLACK or solid gray in nature.
	Really! Go and ask them! They will open your eyes.
