A personal sandbox to try stuff out.","body":"# Wired – A responsive shop wireframe\r\n\r\nBeing a kid, did you love to play in the sand building castles and all? I did not. Well, actually, I did but I hated to get my hands covered in sand and initially felt the urge to wash them. Yes, I was a weird kid.\r\n\r\nNow, this is not weird but *Wired* and my personal responsive sandbox to play with built as a wireframe for a shop. I feel quite merry as I start the project right now. Let's see where I end up with this.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this came up after reading about how much online-shops around the world lack support for mobile devices or are static in their design. Current shop-systems like Magento, Oxid or Shopware come with a lot of restrictions and therefore developers are simply tossing the table ╯°□°）╯┻━┻ when it comes to make a shop really responsive. As I am not the type of guy to refrain from a real challenge... well, here we go.\r\n\r\n## First things First\r\n\r\n**Table of Contents:**\r\n\r\n- [Development Tools](#development-tools)\r\n- [LESStoCSS](#lesstocss)\r\n- [Credits](#credits)\r\n- [License](#license)\r\n\r\n## Development Tools\r\n\r\nI'm using *[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)* with the following tasks:\r\n\r\n- [htmlhint](https://github.com/yaniswang/grunt-htmlhint)\r\n- [less](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-less)\r\n- [autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer)\r\n- [cssmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin)\r\n- [concat](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat)\r\n- [uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify)\r\n- [imagemin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin)\r\n- [watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)\r\n\r\n## LESStoCSS\r\n\r\nThe way I structure my LESS files to create beautiful CSS is well documented in the files themselves. So, if you are really interested dive into the LESS-directory, open a file and read what's there ot know what's going on where and why.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThis work of mine wouldn't be possible without a few people around the globe, who helped me becoming the person/developer I am today. Apart from my family and friends those people are nerdy, geeky, techy web developers, engineers or designers and I love them to bits for their work, enthusiasm and other good things like inspiration and foremost their help.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the terms of the WTFPL (Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License).\r\n\r\nYou may want to take look into this [license file](https://github.com/MarcoKunz/responsive-wireframe/blob/master/LICENSE.md).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
