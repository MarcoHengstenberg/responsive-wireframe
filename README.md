# Wired – A responsive shop wireframe

Being a kid, did you love to play in the sand building castles and all? I did not. Well, actually, I did but I hated to get my hands covered in sand and initially felt the urge to wash them. Yes, I was a weird kid.

Now, this is not weird but *Wired* and my personal responsive sandbox to play with built as a wireframe for a shop. I feel quite merry as I start the project right now. Let's see where I end up with this.

The idea for this came up after reading about how much online-shops around the world lack support for mobile devices or are static in their design. Current shop-systems like Magento, Oxid or Shopware come with a lot of restrictions and therefore developers are simply tossing the table ╯°□°）╯┻━┻ when it comes to make a shop really responsive. As I am not the type of guy to refrain from a real challenge... well, here we go.

## LESStoCSS

The way I structure my LESS files to create beautiful CSS is well documented in the files themselves. So, if you are really interested, you'll have to open a `.less`-file and read what's there.

## Credits

This work of mine wouldn't be possible without a few people around the globe, who helped me becoming the person/developer I am today. Those people are nerdy, geeky, techy web developers, engineers or designers and I love them to bits for their work, enthusiasm and other good things like inspiration and foremost their help.
