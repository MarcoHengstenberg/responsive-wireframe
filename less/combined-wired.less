/*
	Here I am going to bring all the different LESS files into order.

	I usually start with my mixins- or variables-file, adding a reset to the game
	and then go on with loading fonts (if needed) and apply them to all the selectors.

	You won't find a lot of prefixed values apart from those overwriting UA styles as
	I am using autoprefixer. A wonderful Grunt Plugin adding those needed and leaving out
	unneeded ones, based on the caniuse.com database.

	Just to say it in here as well: I support all current browsers and three versions back.

	I do not support IE7 or older.

  IE8 will get a stylesheet especially for that browser with the HTML5 shiv. Both inside
  a conditional.
