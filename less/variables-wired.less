	Basic font color â€“ we don't want black or #333
	Not only is it boring but it is also a wee bit stupid to
	think that anywhere in nature such a plain color would appear.

	Ask "designers" or "photographers" with a lot of experience and they
	will tell you that there is no true BLACK or solid gray in nature.
	Really! Go and ask them! They will open your eyes.

  This is a new thing to me and I'll see if it works out for me.
  I'm going to replace the initial comment on all my media-query
  focussed less-files and the value inside the query itself.

  So, for example I could do this:

  @first-breakpoint: 5em;

  And later on write:

  @media whatever and (min-width: @first-breakpoint)

  That way I can always go to my variables and alter the values here
  instead of going to those files and change the values there.

  Might be cool, dunno. Will see.
